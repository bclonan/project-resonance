    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook serves as a live, interactive, and irrefutable demonstration of the `phicomp` compression library. Its purpose is to address and definitively refute potential skepticism by instrumenting the code, verifying its correctness, and analyzing its performance on various data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will prove the following:\n",
    "1.  The compression is **real and lossless** (the round-trip test).\n",
    "2.  The size measurements are **correct and include the header**.\n",
    "3.  The algorithm correctly handles **incompressible (random) data**.\n",
    "4.  The performance on a standard benchmark **matches our claims**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the final step in moving from theory to proven reality."

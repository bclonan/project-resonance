You are contributing to a Fibonacci-grid-based compression engine using C++ and pybind11.

Goals:
- Implement RGBD tensor smoothing into frequency modeling
- Use grid position (x=F(n)%10, y=F(n+1)%10, t=n%60) to write and read memory
- Apply Ï†-blended bias toward the last seen symbol
- Output a Markdown report of compression quality

Code is in: phiresearch_compression/
Entry point: Codec::encode_bytes(), decode_bytes()
Python bindings in: bindings/
